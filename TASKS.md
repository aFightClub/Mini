# Mini - Image Minification App

## Project Overview

Mini is a desktop application built with Electron v35 and React that enables users to optimize images for web use. The app allows selecting multiple images, minifying them, optionally converting to WebP format, and overwriting the originals with optimized versions.

## Core Features

- [x] Select multiple images at once
- [x] Minify/optimize images for web use
- [x] Option to convert images to WebP format
- [x] Overwrite original images with optimized versions
- [x] Display progress bar for each image being processed
- [x] Show total processing time

## Development Tasks

### Setup

- [x] Initialize Electron v35 project with React
- [x] Configure build system and dependencies
- [x] Set up basic application structure

### UI Implementation

- [x] Create main application window
- [x] Implement image selection interface
- [x] Design image list/queue display
- [x] Create progress indicators per image
- [x] Add total progress and time tracking
- [x] Implement settings panel for optimization options

### Core Functionality

- [x] Implement image selection and file dialog
- [x] Add image processing and optimization logic
- [x] Implement WebP conversion functionality
- [x] Create file overwrite mechanism
- [x] Build progress tracking system
- [x] Add cancelation and error handling

### Polish and Testing
